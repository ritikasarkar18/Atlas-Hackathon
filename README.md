# Atlas-Hackathon - HandRight
Handright converts your pdf document into a handwritten one

1. Start a virtual environment following steps suitable to your os
2. run python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. start django server using python3.6 src/manage.py runserver
3. navigate to the prompted url to access application
ADVANTAGE
IF/WHEN EXPORTING YOUR WORD FILE AS A PDF PLEASE USE THE "Suitable for electronic distribution option" INSTEAD OF "Suitable for printing" (which somehow breaks the PDF text extractor python library)

If you run into a locale error set the approprate environment variable.
THIS PROJECT ONLY SUPPORTS PYTHON3.6
